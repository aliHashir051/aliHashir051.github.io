		<h2 id="unreal-title"> Unreal Engine 5</h2>
		<p>
			Unreal Engine 5 was revealed on May 13, 2020, supporting all existing systems including the next-generation consoles <a href="/wiki/PlayStation_5" title="PlayStation 5">PlayStation 5</a>
			and <a href="/wiki/Xbox_Series_X/S" class="mw-redirect" title="Xbox Series X/S">Xbox Series X/S</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-112" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-112">[112]</a></sup>
			Work on the engine started about two years prior to its announcement.<sup id="cite_ref-vb_ue5_genchange_113-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-vb_ue5_genchange-113">[113]</a></sup>
			It was released in early access on May 26, 2021,<sup id="cite_ref-114" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-114">[114]</a></sup> and formally launched for developers on April 5,
			2022.<sup id="cite_ref-115" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-115">[115]</a></sup>
		</p>

		<p>
			One of its major features is Nanite, an engine that allows for high-detailed photographic source material to be imported into games.
			<sup id="cite_ref-gibiz_ue5_116-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gibiz_ue5-116">[116]</a></sup> The Nanite virtualized geometry technology allows Epic to take advantage of its past
			acquisition of Quixel, the world's largest <a href="/wiki/Photogrammetry" title="Photogrammetry">photogrammetry</a> library as of 2019. The goal of Unreal Engine 5 was to make it as easy 
			as possible for developers to create detailed game worlds without having to spend excessive time on creating new detailed assets.
			<sup id="cite_ref-vb_ue5_genchange_113-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-vb_ue5_genchange-113">[113]</a></sup> Nanite can import nearly any other pre-existing three-dimension representation 
			of objects and environments, including <a href="/wiki/ZBrush" title="ZBrush">ZBrush</a> and <a href="/wiki/CAD" class="mw-redirect" title="CAD">CAD</a> models, enabling the use of 
			film-quality assets.<sup id="cite_ref-117" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-117">[117]</a></sup> Nanite automatically handles the 
			<a href="/wiki/Level_of_detail_(computer_graphics)" title="Level of detail (computer graphics)">levels of detail</a> (LODs) of these imported objects appropriate to the target platform and draw distance,
			a task that an artist would have had to perform otherwise.<sup id="cite_ref-arstech_ue5_118-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-arstech_ue5-118">[118]</a></sup> Lumen is another component described
			as a "fully dynamic global illumination solution that immediately reacts to scene and light changes".
			<sup id="cite_ref-arstech_ue5_118-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-arstech_ue5-118">[118]</a></sup>
			<sup id="cite_ref-gibiz_ue5_116-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gibiz_ue5-116">[116]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-119" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-119">[119]</a></sup>
			Lumen eliminates the need for artists and developers to craft a <a href="/wiki/Lightmap" title="Lightmap">lightmap</a> for a given scene, but instead calculates light reflections and shadows on the fly,
			thus allowing for real-time behavior of light sources.<sup id="cite_ref-arstech_ue5_118-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-arstech_ue5-118">[118]</a></sup> Virtual Shadow Maps is another component
			added in Unreal Engine 5 described as "a new shadow mapping method used to deliver consistent, high-resolution shadowing that works with film-quality assets and large, dynamically lit open worlds".
			<sup id="cite_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-120">[120]</a></sup> Virtual Shadow Maps differs from the common shadow map implementation in its extremely high resolution, more detailed 
			shadows, and the lack of shadows popping in and out which can be found in the more common shadow maps technique due to shadow cascades.<sup id="cite_ref-121" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-121">[121]</a></sup>
			Additional components include Niagara for fluid and particle dynamics and Chaos for a physics engine.<sup id="cite_ref-vb_ue5_genchange_113-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-vb_ue5_genchange-113">[113]</a></sup>

			With potentially tens of billions of polygons present on a single screen at <a href="/wiki/4K_resolution" title="4K resolution">4K resolution</a>, Epic also developed the Unreal Engine 5 to take advantage of the 
			upcoming high-speed storage solutions with the next-generation console hardware that will use a mix of RAM and custom <a href="/wiki/Solid-state_drive" title="Solid-state drive">solid-state drives</a>.
			<sup id="cite_ref-arstech_ue5_118-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-arstech_ue5-118">[118]</a></sup> Epic had worked closely with Sony in optimizing Unreal Engine 5 for the PlayStation 5, with Epic
			collaborating with Sony on the console's storage architecture.<sup id="cite_ref-122" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-122">[122]</a></sup>  To demonstrate the ease of creating a detailed world with minimal 
			effort, the May 2020 reveal of the engine showcased a demo called "Lumen in the Land of Nanite" running on a PlayStation 5 that was built mostly by pulling assets from the Quixel library and using the Nanite, 
			Lumen, and other Unreal Engine 5 components to create a <a href="/wiki/Photorealistic_rendering" class="mw-redirect" title="Photorealistic rendering">photorealistic</a> cave setting that could be explored.
			sup id="cite_ref-vb_ue5_genchange_113-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-vb_ue5_genchange-113">[113]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-123" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-123">[123]</a></sup> Epic affirmed 
			that Unreal Engine 5 would be fully supported on the Xbox Series X as well, but had been focused on the PlayStation 5 during the announcement as a result of their work with Sony in the years prior.
			<sup id="cite_ref-124" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-124">[124]</a></sup> Epic plans to use <i><a href="/wiki/Fortnite" title="Fortnite">Fortnite</a></i> as a testbed for Unreal Engine 5 to showcase
			what the engine can do to the industry,<sup id="cite_ref-vb_ue5_genchange_113-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-vb_ue5_genchange-113">[113]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-125" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-125">[125]</a></sup> 
			with the game brought to use Unreal Engine 5 in December 2021.<sup id="cite_ref-126" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-126">[126]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Ninja_Theory" title="Ninja Theory">Ninja Theory</a>'s 
			<i><a href="/wiki/Senua%27s_Saga:_Hellblade_II" class="mw-redirect" title="Senua's Saga: Hellblade II">Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</a></i> will also be one of the first games to use Unreal Engine 5.
			<sup id="cite_ref-127" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-127">[127]</a></sup> <i><a href="/wiki/The_Matrix_Awakens" title="The Matrix Awakens">The Matrix Awakens</a></i>, a tie-in experience ahead of the release
			of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Matrix_Resurrections" title="The Matrix Resurrections">The Matrix Resurrections</a></i>, was developed by Epic to be a further demonstration of Unreal Engine 5 along with other technology 
			that they had acquired over 2020 and 2021, including their MetaHuman Creator developed and integrated into Unreal Engine 5 with technology from 3Lateral, Cubic Motion, and Quixel.
			<sup id="cite_ref-128" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-128">[128]</a></sup>
			</p>

		<p>
			Additional features planned for Unreal Engine 5 come from Epic's acquisitions and partnerships. The MetaHuman Creator is a project based on technology from three companies acquired by Epic—3Lateral, Cubic Motion, 
			and Quixel—to allow developers to quickly create realistic human characters that can then be exported for use within Unreal.<sup id="cite_ref-129" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-129">[129]</a></sup>   
			Through partnership with Cesium, Epic plans to offer a free plugin to provide 3D <a href="/wiki/Geospatial_metadata" title="Geospatial metadata">geospatial</a> data for Unreal users, allowing them to recreate 
			any part of the mapped surface of Earth.<sup id="cite_ref-130" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-130">[130]</a></sup> Epic will include <a href="/wiki/RealityCapture" title="RealityCapture">RealityCapture</a>, 
			a product it acquired with its acquisition of Capturing Reality that can generate 3D models of any object from a collection of photographs taken of it from multiple angles,
			<sup id="cite_ref-131" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-131">[131]</a></sup> and the various <a href="/wiki/Middleware" title="Middleware">middleware</a> tools offered by <a href="/wiki/RAD_Game_Tools" class="mw-redirect" title="RAD Game Tools">

			Unreal Engine 5 will retain the current royalty model, with developers returning 5% of gross revenues to Epic Games, though this fee is waived for those that release their games on the
			<a href="/wiki/Epic_Games_Store" title="Epic Games Store">Epic Games Store</a>. Further, Epic announced alongside Unreal Engine 5 that they will not take any fee from games using any version of Unreal Engine for the first
